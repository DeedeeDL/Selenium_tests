In this repository I put some scripts which I wrote in Selenium and Python to automate the testing for website of the associaton ("Asociatia Oportunitati si Cariere).
There will be 2 branches :
- the main one where the code has been written in a default format.
- the second branch "BDD" where the code has been written in the BDD and Gerkin format.
